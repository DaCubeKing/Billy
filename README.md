**If you plan on building it yourself, you'll need zip4j (http://www.lingala.net/zip4j.html) and Gson (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.5).**

* To extract the timelines from a Replay, simply open it in one of the 2 slots (*Open Replay 1* or *Open Replay 2*), they will automatically be extracted to `.minecraft\replay_recordings\extractor_temp`

* To transfer a timeline from one Replay to an other, open the Replay that contains the timeline on the first slot (*Open Replay 1*), and open the Replay that will have a copy of the timeline in the second slot (*Open Replay 2*).
You might notice that your timelines will automatically show on the screen. You can now select your timeline (you can select multiple timelines at once), and click the `Copy`/`Move` button to copy/move the selected timeline to the desired side.

* To save the timelines in the replay, click the `File` dropdown menu, and choose which side you want to save (you can save both at the same time)

* You can select a already extracted timeline file (`timelines.json`) instead of a Replay file if you want
