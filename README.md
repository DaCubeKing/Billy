**If you plan on building it yourself, you'll need zip4j (http://www.lingala.net/zip4j.html) and Gson (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.5).**

* To extract the timelines from a Replay, simply open it in one of the 2 slots (*Open Replay 1* or *Open Replay 2*), they will automatically be extracted to `.minecraft\replay_recordings\extractor_temp`

* To transfer a timeline from one Replay to an other, simply open both Replays (one on each side). You might notice that your timelines will automatically show on the screen. You can now select your timeline (you can select multiple timelines at once), and click the `Copy`/`Move` button to copy/move the selected timeline to the desired side.

* To rename a timeline, select it and click the rename button

* To delete a timeline, select it and click the delete button

* To save the timelines in the replay, click the `File` dropdown menu, and choose which side you want to save (you can save both at the same time)

* You can select a already extracted timeline file (`timelines.json`) instead of a Replay file if you want
