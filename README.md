If you plan on building it yourself, you'll need zip4j (http://www.lingala.net/zip4j.html).

To extract the timeline, open a Replay in the first slot ("Select Replay 1" button), then click "Extract timeline without inserting".
To insert a timeline from a Replay to an other Replay, open the Replay that contains the timeline you want to extract in slot 1 ("Select Replay 1" button), open the Replay that will get a copy of the timeline in slot 2 ("Select Replay 2" button) and click "Extract and insert timeline". Both replays must to be selected (and of course they must not be the same file) before extracting the timeline
